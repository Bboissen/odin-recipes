      Descrition: This is an adaptation of the official lasagne from the
      Bolognese Chamber of Commerce. I've made a couple of changes suggested to
      me by people from the area, such as which meat and wine to use or if there
      should be milk added or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing never in question, though, is the green lasagne sheets. These
      are a must. The ragu is an authentic sauce, simple without garlic or herbs
      and spices. Using fresh pasta keeps you from having to pre-boil it.
    </p>
    <p>Ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed</li>

    </ul>
