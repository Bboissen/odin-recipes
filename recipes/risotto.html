      A friend of mine, an experienced mushroom forager, gave me a jar of her
      porcini mushroom powder. It's like brown gold! I added it to my usual
      mushroom risotto and I must say, it's the best mushroom risotto I've ever
      made.

      One thing never in question, though, is the green lasagne sheets. These
      are a must. The ragu is an authentic sauce, simple without garlic or herbs
      and spices. Using fresh pasta keeps you from having to pre-boil it.
    </p>
    <p>Ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>4 cups low-fat chicken broth</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon porcini mushroom powder</li>
      <li>1 shallot, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 cup Arborio rice</li>
      <li>1 bay leaf</li>
      <li>⅓ cup dry white wine</li>
      <li>8 ounces mixed mushrooms</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter salt</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
      <li>roughly chopped ½ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Instructions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>

        cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        In large skillet over medium heat, sauté onion in olive oil until

        followed by ricotta mixture. Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese. Repeat the
        layers ending with noodles on top. Spread Alfredo sauce on top of
        noodles and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
